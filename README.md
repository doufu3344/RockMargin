# RockMargin
This is a visual stutio extension which replaces VS's vertical scrollbar with current text document overview that works as scrollbar at the same time. I just updated shashClp's code to VS2013 and fixed a bug of setting hightlight words'color not work. Detail infomation about this extension please refer to https://github.com/shashClp/RockMargin
